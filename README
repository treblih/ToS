You need Bochs.

If you just want a glance,
use --
	./configure && make && sudo make install
	to compile & install Bochs,
or --
	./configure --enable-debugger --enable-disasm && make && sudo make intall
	to have a Bochs with debugger,
or --
	./configure --enable-gdb-stub && make && sudo make intall
	to have a Bochs with GDB interface.

(Bochs debugger & gdb-stub are mutually exclusive)
